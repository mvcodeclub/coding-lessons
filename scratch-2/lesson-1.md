## Overview
So, we spend the last 8 weeks learning how to use Scratch, and each of you made your own game.  This session, we are going to start making a more advanced game called platformer.  

Let's talk about what is a platformer?

Things we're going to learn to make a platformer:

* Jumping and Gravity
* Bouncing
* Velocity
* Shooting
* Negative Numbers
* Coordinates
* Inventory
* Scene Changes


## Lesson
1 - Make a character and several platforms.  Platforms should be the same colors

2 - Use the space bar to make your character jump (simple)

3 - Introduce gravity so that your character falls

4 - Introduce velocity and acceleration so that he doesn't jump at the same speed


## Review

## Advanced / Homework
Can you make your character bounce?
Use variables to make him jump at different speeds
Use inventory to give him a super boost
