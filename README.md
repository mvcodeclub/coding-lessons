==============

A repository for all the coding lessons I am teaching

Currently, I am teaching a few 4th graders an intro to coding class.

Check out [4th-grade-coding](https://github.com/tarr11/coding-lessons/tree/master/4th-grade-coders) for more information.
You are welcome to use, copy, fork, these lessons.  I believe coding curricula works best when it's open.  So, feel free to add comments, pull requests, etc, for things that you think work better or worse.
