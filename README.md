==============

A repository for all the coding lessons I am teaching

Currently, I am teaching a few 4th graders an intro to coding class.

Check out [4th-grade-coding](https://github.com/tarr11/coding-lessons/tree/master/4th-grade-coders) for more information on the curriculum.

I am also blogging about the actual class experience on [my personal website](http://douglastarr.com/mvcoders.html)

## CodeClub Software

This project is designed to work with the software (MIT Licensed) I am building at https://github.com/tarr11/codeclub	

You can just view the class info right here, and it should be fine too.   My thought is that if you create your own curricula, you can then just pull it into the codeclub software and use it instantly for your class.  That doesn't exist yet, but it's the idea.    Curricula is just going to be markdown and maybe media assets, so if you want to use it somewhere else, that's cool too.

## MIT License
You are welcome to use, copy, fork, these lessons.  

I believe coding curricula works best when it's open.  

So, feel free to add comments, pull requests, etc, for things that you think work better or worse.

## Help
If you are teaching a coding class and have curricula to share, please let me know and I'll link to it!
