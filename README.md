A repository for all the coding lessons I am teaching

Currently, I am teaching a few 4th graders an intro to coding class.

Check out [4th-grade-coding](https://github.com/tarr11/coding-lessons/tree/master/4th-grade-coders) for more information.

This project is designed to work with the software I am building at https://github.com/tarr11/codeclub	but you can just view the class info right here, and it should be fine too.   My thought is that if you create your own curricula, you can then just pull it into the codeclub software and use it instantly for your class.  That doesn't exist yet, but it's the idea.    Curricula is just going to be markdown and maybe media assets, so if you want to use it somewhere else, that's cool too.

You are welcome to use, copy, fork, these lessons.  I believe coding curricula works best when it's open.  So, feel free to add comments, pull requests, etc, for things that you think work better or worse.
