# Lesson 1

## Overview
The goal of this class is to get everyone to understand what programming is, what they want to do with it, and why it could be fun.  We'd like to spend most of the class actually writing code.

## Introduction (10 Minutes)
* What is programming?
* Why do we care about programming?
* What do you want to make?

## Setup (10 Minutes)
* Get wifi working, Chrome installed
* Go to [MVCoders Website](http://mvcodeclub.azurewebsites.net) and log in
* Click on Lesson 1 (that's where this should be)

## Intro to Chat system (10 minutes)
We are going to use Chat to communicate.  I will be available on chat when you need help.
Everyone tries out Chat.
Chat rules:
* No abusive language, teasing, etc
* Chat is for the class only

## Lesson: Javascript
Javascript is a programming language that lets you build games and web pages.  Javascript is one of the languages we are going to learn.

* You have to type something exactly as it appears to make it work.
* You should learn how to copy / paste
* Semicolons, parentheses, and whitespace

## Code Combat (45 minutes)
We are going to spend the rest of the class on [Code Combat](http://codecombat.com) 

## Review 
Write down on your page what you learned today, and what you want to do next.

## Homework
Keep going on Code Combat!  Get as far as you can.  Keep practicing typing.  The faster you can type, the faster you can code.

## Next Week
Next week, we are going to introduce MIT Scratch and make a game together.
