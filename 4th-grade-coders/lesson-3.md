## What is painting and drawing?
Painting (bitmap) uses pixels.

Drawing (vector) uses lines and makes shapes that you can change around.

How is drawing and painting different on a computer than on paper?


## Scratch Drawing and Painting Tools (45 minutes)

We are going to create our own character, using the painting and drawing tools.

### Painting
Let's create a new sprite, using the "Paint New Sprite Tool"

* Make an oval
* Color it in
* Try a different color
* Make a circle (shift-drag)
* Make a rectangle
* Select the drawing
* Copy it around
* Fill it in with the paint bucket
* Stamp a copy

### Drawing
Now that we've painted, we're going to do some drawing
* Make an oval
* Color it in
* Use the reshape tool
* Twist it around
* Make a copy
* Group things together, then ungroup them

### Animating
Let's make a copy of our costume and modify it a little into a second costume.
String together costumes makes it look like we are moving.  THis is called Animation.

### Modifying other drawings
* Grab an example from the library
* Change the color
* Ungroup things
* Change color.
* Resize

## Challenge
Create a sprite with 2 or 3 costumes, and use some Script blocks that we learned last week to animate him.

## Review
