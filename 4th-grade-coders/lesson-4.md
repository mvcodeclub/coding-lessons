## Lesson: 
We are going to work together in teams to build a story together, using the skills we've learned:

Scripts, Sprites and Animations

## QUICK LESSON - Messages

Messages are a way to tell the computer to do something.
One sprite sends a message, another receives it.

Create 2 sprites, and have one sprite send a message.  THe other one should receive it.

## Challenge
Choose teams of 2 (3 if we have to)

The goal of this class is to work with your teammate to build a story, using sprites

### The RULES
* Create at least 2 characters.
* See if you can make it at least 3 minutes long
* Animate your characters using different costumes
* Use messages to control the animation

## Show and Tell
For the last 10 minutes of class, each group will show what they did, and then walk us through their code to show us how they did it.

## Review
