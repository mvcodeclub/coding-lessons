# #5 - Designing your own game


## Lesson: 
This week we are going to learn about variables and lists and create a simple game

## Coding
We're going to create an adventure game.

### Create a map
Make a backdrop that is a map of an area (forests, fields, water, etc)
Create a You win back drop
Create a You lose back drop.

### Create a character, and some items
Create our sprite, create a sword, a potion, and a monster.

Create some coins.

### Keep score!
Create a variable that tracks our score
Create a list that tracks your inventory.
Give points for getting the coins.
Every time you collect something (the sword or the potion) put it in your inventory.
Attack the monster.  If you don't have the sword, the monster kills you and the game is over.
